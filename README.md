<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>

<p align="left">
Iâ€™m a data scientist with 14+ years of engineering experience and a deep passion for solving real-world problems through data. I help businesses predict outcomes, optimize operations, and automate workflows with custom AI solutions.
</p>

I have a strong background in R&D, process development, and production, so I know how to build models that actually work in real life.
