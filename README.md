 In the last 4+ years, I’ve focused on AI, machine learning, Python, and SQL, using these tools to develop data-driven solutions that improve operations and drive business impact.

 My passion for problem-solving and delivering high-quality work has led me to specialize in predictive modeling, process optimization, and data management — working hands-on with large datasets and building robust ETL pipelines. I hold certifications in Data Science and Machine Learning by IBM and Istanbul Technical University, and I stay motivated by a mindset of curiosity and continuous learning.
